Here's how you might set up the multi-threaded execution:

import threading
import re
from collections import Counter

# Define your program functions here:
def validate_password(password):
    # (The password validation logic will be here)
    pass

def compute_word_frequency(text):
    # (The word frequency logic will be here)
    pass

class CircularQueue:
    # (The circular queue logic will be here)
    pass

# Define your main functions here that use the file inputs:
def main_password_validation(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        passwords = file.read()
    # (The rest of the main_password_validation logic will be here)

def main_word_frequency(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
    # (The rest of the main_word_frequency logic will be here)

def main_circular_queue(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        elements = file.read().split(',')
    cq = CircularQueue(5)
    for element in elements:
        cq.enqueue(element)
        print(f"Enqueued: {element}")
    # (The rest of the main_circular_queue logic will be here)

# Now, set up the threads for each main function:
def setup_threads():
    threads = []
    threads.append(threading.Thread(target=main_password_validation, args=('path_to_passwords_file',)))
    threads.append(threading.Thread(target=main_word_frequency, args=('path_to_text_file',)))
    threads.append(threading.Thread(target=main_circular_queue, args=('path_to_queue_elements_file',)))

    # Start all threads
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()

    # Wait for all threads to complete
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

if _name_ == "_main_":
    setup_threads()

In this setup, you'll need to replace 'path_to_passwords_file', 'path_to_text_file', and 'path_to_queue_elements_file' with the actual paths to the files that contain the inputs for each of the functions.

You can use this structure to read inputs from files located in a separate sub-folder, as per your requirements. You would just need to make sure the paths you provide are correct.
