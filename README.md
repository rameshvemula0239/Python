# Python

In this Multi thread setup, you'll need to replace 'path_to_passwords_file', 'path_to_text_file', and 'path_to_queue_elements_file' with the actual paths to the files that contain the inputs for each of the functions.

You can use this structure to read inputs from files located in a separate sub-folder, as per your requirements. You would just need to make sure the paths you provide are correct.
